# Steps in establishing correspondence in the comparative method
1. assemble semantically equivalent forms
2. identify cognates
	1. a cognate is a word which is related to a word in sister languages by reason of these forms having been inherited by these sister languages from a common word of the proto-language from which the sister languages descend
3. establish regular sound correspondence
	1. but before, discard any unrelated forms
4. reconstruct a proto-sound and posit sound changes
5. repeat with more data
