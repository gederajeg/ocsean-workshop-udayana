- obtain data to analyse the grammar of a language
- document oral history

## Processing a text recording
- save, rename and back up your files

# Steps in establishing correspondence in the comparative method
1. assemble semantically equivalent forms
2. identify cognates
	1. a cognate is a word which is related to a word in sister languages by reason of these forms having been inherited by these sister languages from a common word of the proto-language from which the sister languages descend
3. establish regular sound correspondence
	1. but before, discard any unrelated forms
4. reconstruct a proto-sound and posit sound changes
5. repeat with more data

## confounding issues -- similarities due to some factors
- chance similarities (e.g., Sanskrit *dva* and Malay *dua*; Ainu *abe, api* and Malay *api*)
- language universals (e.g., words for MOTHER across languages [i.e., Spanish *mamaÃÅ*, Samoan *mama*])
- borrowing

### Correspondence set
- definition: "Which sounds correspond to which sounds in another language"

## Principals of historical linguistics
- avoid unconditional splits
- posit common sound changes (e.g., lenition)

- posit the least number of sound changes possible
- avoid positing novel proto-phonemes
- try to reconstruct a realistic proto-language
