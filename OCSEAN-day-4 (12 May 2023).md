## Benefits of the Comparative Method
- indication of laws governing language change
- insights into languages, cultures, and living of pre-historic or past oral populations
- diachronic study essential to understand synchronic elements of language
- an important source for other fields of prehistory:
	- archaeology
	- palaeoanthropology
	- palaeogenetics
	- culture-historical studies

## Computational Methods in Historical Linguistics
- Transfers of ideas and methods from computational biology
	- guided by the idea that biological and linguistic diversification processes are analogous
- availability of large electronic data resources suitable for systematic comparative work
- typical cognate-coded databases *Austronesian Basic Vocabulary*
- gain insights into historical processes

## Why computational method in historical linguistics?
- replicability - all steps are transparent and data is available
- rigorous evaluation - quantitative evaluation
- separation of training and test data
- only raw data as input
	- that is, no prior assumptions associated with the input data (e.g., word lists in orthographic or phonetic transcription produced without diachronic information)
	- excludes many databases items and expert classifications (e.g., Ethnologue)
