# Preliminaries of making a recording

- find a speaker

- pick a quiet room

- avoid spaces with:

	- motorcycles driving by

	- Fridge noise

	- AC noise

	- Children screaming

	- Distraction


# Recording using the phone

- We can plug a microphone into the phone for the speaker to use.

# High tech recording

- familarise ourselves with the recording tool
	- practice beforehand
	- have backup means (e.g., phone, extra voice recorder)
	- anticipate what could go wrong
	- carry multiple batteries and an SD card (plastic case)
		- make sure they are fully charged and have space

# What equipment is necessary
- a camera with an external mic plugin
- external microphone
- connection cable for microphone and camera (2-3 m)
- tripod for the camera
- *minitripod* for the microphone
- a pair of headphones
- separate audio recording device (as backup)
- extra batteries for the camera, external microphone, audio-recorder
- memory card for the camera, audio recorder

### Recommended tool
- 2nd pair of headphones and headphone splitter
- mini-tripod for audio recorder
- Bluetooth speakers

# Important considerations
- ensure that audio and video recordings are done using the __*same*__ device
- connect an external microphone to a video camera
- camera focus to the speaker with half-body shown (hands shown)
- don't do zoom in and zoom out
- pay attention to natural light (natural light should go to the speaker's face)
	- with long recording, prepare auto-setting for the light


# What is a wordlist?
- a list containing a series of words, typically alongside a translation into another language
- A wordlist can be any length (200-300 words), but the longer the better (600-1200 words)

### Aims of wordlist collection
- obtain initial data about a new language of study
	- e.g., initial exploration of the sound system of the language
- collect comparable data from different languages
- create a record of a language

# Wordlist collection 

## First method

1. print out a hard copy of Wordlist
2. sit down with the speaker(s) and fill in the wordlist using pen and paper
3. once the wordlist has been fully filled in, make a recording of the speaker uttering the words in the local language
4. transcription: type the wordlist in Excel using the template (listen to the recording again)

Recommended: It would also be ideal if you record step 2 (the elicitation process)

### word collection

1. sit with a speaker (ideally a group)
2. ask for the target word and repeat it back to the speaker(s)
3. when they are happy with your pronunciation, write it down
4. use IPA and/or local orthography

Note: when the words are not available, just skip

## Second method

1. Record the whole process without doing note-taking (the first method is the recording happens at a different time, if we have more time and it is cleaner)
